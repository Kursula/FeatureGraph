# Graph tools for Machine Learning 

This repository is a collection of graph tools for Machine Learning. 

Currently implemented:
* Lightweight graph framework for constructing a graph and doing elementary operations with it. 
* Graph layout optimization using Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm adapted from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04626.pdf
* Automatic Delaunay triangulation based graph edge definition.
* Edge weighted Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest path between graph vertices.
* Graph plotting.


## Animal face graph notebook
This notebook shows simple example how to construct a graph based on image feature vectors and how to do some fun and probably useless things with it.
